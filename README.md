In this project students should develop a web application used to manage/control room occupancy.
In an organization such as IST, some rooms are available for public use by the students. In order to understand the occupancy of such rooms it is necessary to register when a student is studding on such rooms.
The system will be operated by two different class of users: admins and students. Admins manage rooms by making them available for use and observe current occupancy. Students check in/out in rooms and search for friends location.
